                        Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed are a trio of villainous hyenas who play a pivotal role in the classic movie, The Lion King. Shenzi is the leader of the pack, with a fierce and cunning personality. 
                        Banzai is the second in command, known for his brash and impulsive nature. Ed, on the other hand, is a comically dim-witted hyena, who rarely speaks and communicates mostly through laughter.
                        Together, they form a menacing and dangerous group, serving as Scar's henchmen and carrying out his orders. The hyenas are known for their viciousness, their unyielding loyalty to Scar,
