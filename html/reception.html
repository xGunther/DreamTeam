            <p>
                Since the age of the World Wide Web people can be more connected than ever and they are willing to share their opinions about everything that keeps them busy. When it comes to movies it's no different, as movie reviewers/film critics are an essential part of the success that comes to the film itself. Studies have shown that reviewers can influence moviegoers in the opening weeks of the film. We dedicated this page to show, nearly 30 years later, the initial reception and release of The Lion King. This reception includes reviews by film critics and the general public, it also includes money earned by the original iteration of this classic.

                The initial release was on the 15th of June in only <strong>2(!)</strong> theaters located in the United States. The world wide release quickly followed about a week later on the 24th of June 1994, which was released in 2550 different theaters worldwide. The latter release has been localized to the maximum. The Lion King was made in 28(and <strong>45!</strong> in 2023) different versions, which all had different languages. Fun fact : The Zulu, a native South-African language, version was a first timer, as it was the first dubbed movie in any African language.

                One year later Disney released the home media for The Lion King. It was initially released on VHS, which is old by today's standards, and laserdisc, which looks like a DVD/CD disk. The VHS quickly became the most sold videotape in the history (!) of the U.S. with 4.5 million copies sold on the first day only. Forwarding to 2023 it is still the most sold videotape, if all video types are accumulated. The Lion King has sold over 48 million copies across VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray in the United States. There is not much documentation about the overseas copies, but it is known that 23 million units were shipped to sell overseas.
