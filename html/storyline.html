                <h2>The Pride Lands</h2>
                <p class="storyline">
                    The story of "The Lion King" is set in the Pride Lands, a vast and beautiful African savanna ruled by Mufasa, a wise and powerful lion king who has a deep respect for the Circle of Life. Mufasa has a son named Simba, who is destined to take over as king one day. Simba is curious, adventurous, and eager to learn from his father about the responsibilities of being a king.

                <p class ="storyline">
                    However, Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, is jealous of his brother's position and wants to be king himself. Scar is bitter and resentful, and he schemes to get rid of Mufasa and Simba so that he can take over the Pride Lands. Scar's plan involves enlisting the help of a pack of hyenas, who are known to be vicious and ruthless animals.

                <p class="storyline">
                    One day, Scar lures Simba into a gorge and tells him to wait there while he goes to get Mufasa. In reality, Scar has set a trap for both Mufasa and Simba. Scar signals the hyenas to start a stampede of wildebeest, and Mufasa rushes to the gorge to save Simba. However, he is unable to outrun the wildebeest and is killed in the stampede, leaving Simba feeling guilty and responsible for his father's death.

                    Scar convinces Simba that he is responsible for Mufasa's death and that he should leave the Pride Lands and never return. Simba runs away, leaving Scar to take over as the new king of the Pride Lands. Simba wanders alone in the desert until he collapses from exhaustion. He is rescued by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa, who become his friends and teach him to live by the philosophy of "Hakuna Matata," which means "no worries" in Swahili.

                    Years pass, and Simba grows up into a carefree adult lion who spends his days lounging with Timon and Pumbaa. However, Nala, Simba's childhood friend, finds him and tells him that the Pride Lands have become a barren wasteland under Scar's rule. She also informs Simba that Scar is responsible for Mufasa's death and urges him to return to the Pride Lands and reclaim his rightful place as king.

With the help of his friends, Timon and Pumbaa, as well as the other animals of the Pride Lands, Simba engages in a fierce battle with Scar and his hyena army.
