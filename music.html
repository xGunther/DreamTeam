                A great movie always has a great soundtrack that sticks with you for years upon decades later. The Lion King is no exception to this, 
                as it has many classics in their soundtrack list. The tracks mentioned on this page are part of the <strong>Original Motion Picture Sountrack</strong>
                released in 1994. Furthermore this music section will mention facts about every song in the film and will refer to links for these songs.

                <p class="music">
                    <strong>Circle of Life</strong> was composed by the famous Elton John and the lyrics were written by Tim Rice, who is an English lyricist and author.
                    Furthermore the song was performed by Lebo Morake, who did the opening vocals in the <a class="music" href="">Zulu</a> language, and Carmen Twillie, who is the lead vocalist of the track.
                    The song was nominated for both the Acadamy Award for Best Original Song and the Song of the Year Grammy in 1994, but did not win one of these awards.
